                                <h2>A. What you have gained</h2>
                                <p>First of all, I would like to thank the Technology and Information Systems subject team for giving us the opportunity to participate in the industrial talk given by a well-known speaker, Dr Seah Choon Sen. He gave us a talk about I-Farm, one of his great projects. I learn how to properly outline the process from start to finish, such as starting with problem statements and ending with factual facts such as cost structure. This is the proper way to do a project, so it doesn't leave any aspects that can become a problem in the future. Other than that, I get to see how smart people think of a project like the Dr Seah and I-Farm project; it is not just any other project but a good project that can help other people have a better life.</p><br />
                                <h2>B. Suggest any improvement</h2>
								<p>The industry talk went great, and the amount of time for the talk was perfect, but it started a bit late and made us wait for a while. Other than that, I am not a fan of online industrial talk because I can't keep myself engrossed in the talk like in a physical industrial talk.</p><br />
								<h2>C. Others</h2>
								<p>I really want to see Dr Seah Choon Sen because I am amazed at how well he is doing in his department and how he can think of and realize a big project such as I-Farm that is really a great way to help the community have a better life. I would like to have a conversation with him if I am given the chance.</p><br />
                                <p>Tips:You can click the image to access the full newsletter.</p>
								<p>✨That's all from me Thank you!✨</p>
