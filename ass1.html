                                <h2>A. What you have gained</h2>
                                <p>Personally, for me, first I would like to thank the Technology and Information System team for giving us the opportunity to be involved in the industry talk by Clarity Techworks SDN BHD. This industry talk really gives me a clear view of the job scope for us computer science students. I get to know better what apps and tools are used in each of the panelists' professions.The main point that catches my attention is the difference between work life and studies or internships. There are like opposites to each other, and if I think study is hard, then work life will be a lot harder. That's why I would like to use my study time to gain a lot of skills that can help me ease my burden when I start to work.</p><br />
                                <h2>B. Suggest any improvement</h2>
								<p>The industry talk went great, but the improvement that I would make is to change the industry talk from an online session to a face-to-face session. I think this would help students and me understand more.</p><br />
								<h2>C. Others</h2>
								<p>For me, it is a missed opportunity where I didn't get to have small talk with the panel because sometimes when there are events like this, I tend to walk to them and have a small talk because my questions might be a bit bland to be asked in front of all other students. I think this Technology and Information System team from the Faculty of Computing should really make industry talk an event where it will be conducted face-to-face.</p><br />
                                <p>Tips:You can click the image to access all the report, image, slide and etc.</p>
								<p>✨That's all from me Thank you!✨</p>
